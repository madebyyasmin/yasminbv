✨ Hi, I'm Yasmin — Creative Ops ✕ Product-minded Systems Builder ✨

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I turn messy, complex processes into smooth, delightful workflows. I blend creative operations, product thinking, and automation magic to help teams move faster, stay aligned, and ship beautiful work.

I love building systems that feel intuitive, human-centered, and (yes!) a little bit cute.

🌸 What I Do

💗 Creative operations across art, digital content, and product pipelines

🧩 Process design that makes cross-team collaboration seamless

📊 Data & documentation that keep projects moving and teams in sync

💕 A Little More About Me

I love connecting the dots across creative and technical worlds

I thrive in fast-paced, “figure it out together” environments

I’m happiest when I’m designing systems that feel smooth and friendly

If it can be automated… it probably will be
